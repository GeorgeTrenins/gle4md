      Generalised Langevin Equation - A toy code
*                          *                           *

An awkwardly simple code to test Generalised Langevin
dynamics on a multidimensional harmonic oscillator.

* Program files:
harmonic.f90       main, input parsing and md loop
md-tools.f90       a couple of utility functions 
md-nose.f90        simple implementation of NH chains
md-gle.f90         GLE code, mostly self-contained

* Compilation:
A Makefile is provided, even if the code is so simple 
compilation should be trivial. Adjust environment 
variables in the Makefile's header, and just "make".

* Use:
Input is detailed in the source. Beside the actual input,
one is required a 'freq' file containing the square root
of the Hessian of the harmonic potential, and, if GLE is
to be used, a GLE-A file containing the drift matrix,
in the format
ns
app    ap_1 ... ap_ns
bap_1  A11  ... A1ns
.
bap_ns Ans1 ... Ansns
If non-FDT dynamics is to be performed, a similar GLE-C
is required, containing the covariance matrix.
