      GLE4MD aims to be a collection of tools to simplify the use of colored-noise, 
      generalized Langevin equation thermostats to enhance your molecular dynamics simulations.
      A colored-noise thermostat can be used to <a href="compose.php?page=apps#optimal">enhance canonical sampling</a>,
      in particular in difficult cases such as path integral dynamics, 
      to perform constant-temperature MD in a <b>Car-Parrinello-like dynamics</b>,
      to control resonances in <b>multiple time step</b> dynamics,
      to include  <a href="compose.php?page=apps#quantum">nuclear quantum effects</a> 
      at a fraction of the cost of a path-integrals simulation, 
      to compute the <a href="compose.php?page=apps#piglet">particle momentum distribution</a>, 
      to selectively <a href="compose.php?page=apps#delta">excite a few normal modes</a>, and a number of other
      applications which have not been invented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
      On these pages you will find a collection of ready-to-use GLE parameters,
      and a handy online tool to <a href="compose.php?page=matrix">prepare the GLE section</a> 
      of the input for different programs,
      tools to analyze and fit GLE matrices, sample code to include colored-noise thermostats 
      in your MD code, tutorials and documentation to explain in detail how to 
      use colored noise in your simulation. You will also find information concerning 
      <a href="compose.php?page=ipi">i-PI</a>, a Python interface to perform path integral
      molecular dynamics with ab initio (and empirical) forces, that implements all of the 
      colored-noise machinery.
