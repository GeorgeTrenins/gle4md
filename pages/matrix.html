<h2>GLE Input generator</h2>
<p> 
   This page is designed to generate (or pick from a library) 
   a set of parameters for a generalized Langevin equation, 
   consistent with the kind of simulation and the system chosen.
   Options that are highlighted in red in the drop-down boxes are to
   be considered experimental, and it is recommended that the authors
   of the relevant papers are contacted before using them in a 
   production run.
</p>
<p>
   It will also output the parameters in a format such that they 
   are ready to be used in the input of one of the MD codes which
   officially implement the GLE thermostat (currently, 
   <a href="http://cp2k.berlios.de">CP2K</a>, 
   <a href="http://www.cpmd.org">CPMD</a> and <a href="https://aimsclub.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/">FHI-AIMS</a>).
