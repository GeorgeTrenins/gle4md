    <div class="column">
    A Generalized Langevin dynamics can be tuned so that <i>all</i> the vibrational
    modes in a system of interest behave as if critically damped. This results in a
    more efficient sampling of the constant-temperature canonical ensemble. 
    Interestingly, this tuning can be done in a a-priori fashion, without knowledge 
    of the details of the system of interest, so that this <b>optimal-sampling GLE</b>
    achieves near-ideal sampling efficiency without the need of optimizing the thermostat
    parameters on the system of choice.

    The quantum mechanical behavior of light nuclei (such as hydrogen) can have a dramatic effect
    on physical properties of condensed phase systems. For instance, one can extrapolate the pH of
    isotopically pure waters to the infinite-mass limit, and estimate that a 'classical' water
    would have <b>pH=8.5</b>.
    An appropriate GLE can enforce a phase-space distribution consistent with a quantum harmonic oscillator
    without any significant overhead. This allows one to model nuclear quantum effects in a classical 
    simulation inexpensively. A systematic improvement of the accuracy in strongly anharmonic problems
    can be achieved by combining this approach with path integral molecular dynamics 
    (with a <b>much lower</b> number of replicas than for a fully converged PI simulation).

      <h3> PIGLET and particle momentum distribution </h3>
      <p>
      The PI+GLE method can be improved significantly by also enforcing the centroid fluctuations
      to take on the converged value for a harmonic system and a small number of beads. This allows one
      to compute the <b>quantum kinetic energy</b> estimator very efficiently, which in turns enables the calculation
      of the amplitude of the particle momentum distribution. <br/> By computing also the off-diagonal
      terms of the kinetic energy tensor, and by performing appropriate running averages, one can also get
      in an automatic fashion the anisotropy of the PMD, hence improving the comparison with DINS experiments
      without resorting to open path integrals.

    By tuning the properties of the colored noise it is possible to realize a 
    stochastic dynamics in which only the normal modes within a narrow range of frquencies
    are excited, without prior knowledge of the system's phonon spectrum.
