      The i-PI distribution contains a number of examples and a simple demonstrative driver code
      that can be used as the force backend for a number of simple tests, such as para-hydrogen
      and Lennard-Joens potentials.  The documentation also contains a simple tutorial to
      get started with using i-PI.

      In addition to the tutorial available with the i-PI main distribution, you can also 
      try an additional set of <a href="data/i-pi_hands-on.zip">guided examples</a> that 
      demonstrate some more advanced features of i-PI. Note that these examples use some 
      features (such as qTIP4P/F water and the Zundel cation potentials in the driver code)
      that are only available through the development version of i-PI, a snapshot of which is
      present within the archive.
